1.2 Profession: BMS 

1.3 Registration Number: BS075665 

## Summary of recent work/practice 

This is my first Continuous Professional Development (CPD) profile, starts from Winter 2021. 

In my past years of education, I developed a strong interest in immunology, particularly in the aspects of haematological diseases and cancer. Driven by this passion in mind, I managed to secure a research student position (Investigation of use of small molecule inhibitors in cancer therapy) at Professor Rudd’s laboratory at the Université de Montréal (UdM) in Canada. However, due to the covid restrictions, I was not able to enter Canada immediately after graduation. While waiting for my permission, I secured a post as a Research Associate (RA) in CrownBio, a Contractor Research Company (CRO). I work alongside other scientists in the _in vitro_ oncology group to perform preclinical studies of different cancer drug candidates. 

In 2022, I left CrownBioscience, where I worked as a Research Assistant in its oncology _in-vitro_ group, and started to join Professor Christopher Rudd’s laboratory at the University of Montreal (Canada) from 03/2022. I’ve acquired essential practical skills at CrownBioscience, including cell culturing, maintaining cell population condition, luciferase viability assay _etc._ 

During the first three months in the new laboratory until 07/2022, I concentrated on a project to explore the effect of knocking-out glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) in mice mature T cells. The project was still in progress when this CPD year ended, so I’ve included partial results as evidence. Although my recent work became research-intensive as a research student, I have kept my CPD to be diverse, including a mixture of different types.

## Personal statement

_Evidence 1-5_

**Standard 1 – A registrant must maintain a continuous, up-to-date and accurate record of their CPD activity** 

In addition to storing all relative materials locally on my computer, I store all my CPD documents online, at the Royal Society of Biology (RSB) CPD portal (https://my.rsb.org.uk/cpd.php). This is a secure platform to store information (Evidence 1). 

**Standard 2 – A registrant must identify their CPD activities are a mixture of learning activities relevant to current or future practice** 

As currently I am not working as a BMS in an NHS trust or private healthcare sector, most of my CPD activities will be work-based and self-directed nature. 

Accessing research papers published on well-known journals is an effective way to learn about new methods and findings. In Evidence 2, journal-based self-guided evidence, I assessed a paper titled “Rapid and stable mobilization of CD8+ T cells by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine”. From that paper I learnt techniques related to monitoring cell proliferation and apoptosis, including the Ki-67 and CD38 assays. 

In addition to journal-based evidence, work-based learning including case study and reflective practice could consolidate current theoretical knowledge to real-life practice. In Evidence 5, I recorded an experiment I done at CBBJ. In this _in_ vitro experiment, I treated cancer cells with dexamethasone and cisplatin. 

**Standard 3 – A registrant must seek to ensure that their CPD has contributed to the quality of their practice and service delivery** 

As mentioned in Evidence 2, the Ki-67 assay is a common technology to detect human cancer cell growth, which is highly relevant to my work at CrownBio and UdM. 

**Standard 4 – A registrant must seek to ensure that their CPD benefits to the service user** 

To have a better understand in the post-death pathway, I participated the Medical Examiner (MEX) course online, as described in Evidence 3. Completing such course could help me make better decisions in dealing samples from deceased patients. In Evidence 4, I participated the “Basics in VTE” conference hold by ThrombosisUK. I attended numerous case and scientific presentations, including the diagnosis of thrombosis with the help of haematology lab results. 

_Evidence 6-9_

**Standard 1 – A registrant must maintain a continuous, up-to-date and accurate record of their CPD activity** 

CPD evidence was recorded as soon as possible when all materials were gathered. Doing this could prevent me from losing information or accuracy (evidence 2 and 4). In evidence 2, I participated an IBMS haematological morphology quiz. The quiz covered 

**Standard 2 – A registrant must identify their CPD activities are a mixture of learning activities relevant to current or future practice** 

To make the form of CPD diverse, I have chosen various types of learning methods. Such as journal-based learning (evidence 1), where I read and commented on a paper on the enzymatic conversion of a type A organ to universal. In evidence 2, I participated the IBMS blood science quiz. In evidence 3 and 4, I summarised my research activities. 

**Standard 3 – A registrant must seek to ensure that their CPD has contributed to the quality of their practice and service delivery** 

In evidence 1, I read a paper on the enzymatic conversion of blood type A to universal type (H-antigen only). This method could potentially benefit the current organ shortage. My current research, based on the T cell signalling pathways, also associated with transplantation rejection and graft vs host diseases. 

**Standard 4 – A registrant must seek to ensure that their CPD benefits to the service user** 

To ensure I have up-to-date knowledge of haematology, I participated in the IBMS blood morphology quiz. By reviewing the answer and comments, I had refreshed myself with blood smear, essentially the LLM compartment. I have been working on the role of GSK-3 knockout in mature T cells in mice, and we found it could be a potential treatment target to enhance immunity.
