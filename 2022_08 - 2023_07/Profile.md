# CPD Profile (2022_08 - 2023_07)

## Registrant Information

1.1 Full Name: Chen Liu, AMRSB 

1.2 Profession: BMS 

1.3 Registration Number: BS075665 

## Summary of recent work/practice 

This year, I made sufficient progress towards my MSc thesis. Rather than the GSK3 project, I focused on my main research topic, which is on the function of T-cell adaptor protein, *scr-kinase associated protein-55 kDa*, or SKAP1.

Total words: 37

## Personal statement

_Evidence 1-5_

**Standard 1 – A registrant must maintain a continuous, up-to-date and accurate record of their CPD activity** 

In Evidence 1, I included a small article written by me, describing the latest results from the GSK3 project.

**Standard 2 – A registrant must identify their CPD activities are a mixture of learning activities relevant to current or future practice** 

In Evidence 1 and 2, I participated research project, as well as oral presentations. This demonstrated a variety of forms of CPD activities.

**Standard 3 – A registrant must seek to ensure that their CPD has contributed to the quality of their practice and service delivery** 

As mentioned in Evidence 2 and 3, the lectures ensure that my presentation skills are acceptable and I can deliver clear information to the audience.

**Standard 4 – A registrant must seek to ensure that their CPD benefits to the service user** 

In Evidence 2, I presented an article in the journal club, where the paper discussed the lactic acid metabolism pathway in T cells. This paper is beneficial for our lab as we are interested in T cell metabolism as well.
